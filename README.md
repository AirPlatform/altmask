# Security Flow
**First Time Flow**
1. `appSalt` is generated on a per-install basis
2. User enters `password` in Login page
3. `password` + `appSalt` runs through `scrpyt` encryption for ~3 seconds to generate `passwordHash`
4. User creates or imports wallet
5. `passwordHash` + wallet's `privateKey` runs through `scrypt` encryption for ~1 second to generate `encryptedPrivateKey`
6. Account is saved in storage with `encryptedPrivateKey`

**Return User Flow**
1. User enters password in Login page
2. `password` + `appSalt` runs through `scrpyt` encryption for ~3 seconds to generate `passwordHash`
3. Existing account is fetched from storage
4. `passwordHash` is used to decrypted the `encryptedPrivateKey`. On successful decryption of the wallet, the password is validated.
